# Ansible Playbooks Repository
Welcome to the Ansible Playbooks Repository! This repository contains a collection of Ansible playbooks and related files to automate various tasks and configurations in your infrastructure. Whether you are managing a single server or a complex environment, these playbooks can help you streamline your operations and ensure consistency across your systems.

## Directory Structure

### conditions: 
This directory contains playbooks showcasing conditional execution and control flow within Ansible. It demonstrates how to handle different scenarios and apply specific tasks based on conditions.

### multiple: 
In this directory, you'll find scripts and files for managing multiple hosts simultaneously. It includes a script for setting up SSH key-based authentication across multiple hosts, along with password management and environment configuration files.

### roles: 
The roles directory is where you'll find reusable and modular components for your automation tasks. It includes the common role, which provides common system configurations, and the myrole role, which showcases a sample role structure with tasks, handlers, defaults, and more. Feel free to explore and leverage these roles for your own projects.

### tasks_handlers: 
This directory demonstrates task and handler management in Ansible. It includes playbooks organized by OS type and tasks grouped by handlers. It also showcases variable usage within tasks and handlers.

### test_plays: 
Here you'll find a collection of test playbooks for various purposes, such as pinging hosts, executing custom commands, and testing different configurations. These playbooks can serve as examples to help you get started with Ansible and validate your configurations.

### vars: 
The vars directory contains variable definitions organized by groups and hosts. It also includes variable files for different scenarios and environments. This structure allows you to manage and customize variables based on your specific requirements.

### vault: 
In this directory, you'll find host-specific variables encrypted using Ansible Vault. This provides a secure way to store sensitive information, such as passwords or API keys, and ensures that they can be accessed only by authorized users.

# Getting Started
To use these playbooks and leverage the automation capabilities they provide, follow these steps:
    
    -  Clone the repository to your local machine or Ansible control node.
    
    -  Review the documentation and README files within each directory to understand the purpose and usage of the playbooks and related files.
    
    -  Customize the variables, inventories, and configuration files based on your specific environment and requirements.
    
    -  Run the playbooks using the ansible-playbook command, targeting the appropriate hosts and playbooks.
    
    -  Monitor the output, review logs, and validate the results to ensure that the desired configurations and tasks are successfully applied.

### Please note that this repository serves as a starting point, and you can adapt and extend the playbooks according to your infrastructure's needs. 
Feel free to contribute, provide feedback, and share your own playbooks and improvements with the community.

## Happy automating with Ansible!
